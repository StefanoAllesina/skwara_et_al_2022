# Data Sources

## Kuebbing et al. (2015) 

Two data sets (natives, non-natives). The experiments and data are described here:

*Kuebbing, S. E., Classen, A. T., Sanders, N. J., & Simberloff, D.* (2015). [Above-and below-ground effects of plant diversity depend on species origin: An experimental test with multiple invaders](https://nph.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/nph.13488). New Phytologist, 208 (3), 727–735.

The data was provided by S. Kuebbing.

## Chu et al. (2021)

The data are a subset of those presented in:

*Chu, X.-L., Zhang, Q.-G., Buckling, A., & Castledine, M.* (2021). [Interspecific niche competition increases morphological diversity in multi-species microbial communities](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fmicb.2021.699190/full). Frontiers in Microbiology, 2103.

The original data are available [here](https://figshare.com/articles/dataset/Interspecific_niche_competition_increases_morphological_diversity_in_multi-species_microbial_communities/14471229). Code to extract the data from the original files is found in the folder `chu_2021`


## Ghedini et al. (2022)
